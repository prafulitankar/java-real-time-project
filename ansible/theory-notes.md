###What is Gathering facts?
In Ansible, gathering facts means collecting system information (a.k.a. "facts") about the remote host(s) before running any tasks.
These facts include things like:

- OS type and version
- IP address and hostname
- Available memory and CPU info
- Network interfaces
- Disk space
- Environment variables
- Default shell, Python version, etc.


```
